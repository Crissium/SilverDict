# SilverDict â€“ Web-Based Alternative to ~~GoldenDict~~ MDict

![favicon](/client/public/favicon.ico)

This project is aimed to be a modern, from-the-ground-up, maintainable alternative to [GoldenDict](https://github.com/goldendict/goldendict)(-[ng](https://github.com/xiaoyifang/goldendict-ng)), written with Flask and Vue.js.

You can access the live demo [here](https://www.eplscz1rvblma3qpwsxvrpo930wah.xyz). (Please be polite and do not abuse it, as my knowledge of security is limited. And I've removed the button to delete dictionaries.)

## Screenshots

![Dark](/screenshots/dark.png)

The dark theme is not built in, but rendered with the [DarkReader Firefox extension](https://addons.mozilla.org/en-GB/firefox/addon/darkreader/).

## Features

- Python-powered
- Cleaner code (well, sort of; anyway, I cannot understand much of GoldenDict's code)
- Deployable both locally and on a self-hosted server
- Fast enough (faster than my GoldenDict compiled with Qt 5)
- Minimalist Vue-based frontend
- Separable client and server components

## Roadmap

### Server-side

- [ ] Add support for Babylon BGL glossary format (help wanted!)
- [ ] Add support for StarDict format (help wanted!)
- [ ] Add support for ABBYY Lingvo DSL format (help wanted!)
- [ ] Rewrite the MDict reader class
- [ ] Reorganise APIs
- [ ] Ignore diacritics when searching

StarDict and DSL dictionaries use [`dictzip`](https://github.com/cheusov/dictd) (`.dz`) to compress text files, allowing random access and on-the-fly decompression. Unfortunately, the inner workings of dictzip involving bitwise operations are not well understood. As for BGL, its organisation is completely opaque to me.

This project uses the [Python MDict library](https://bitbucket.org/xwang/mdict-analysis/src/master/) developed by Xiaoqiang Wang. It is not designed for lookups, though, so I should have adapted it specifically for this project instead of directly using it as a base reader.

### Client-side

- [ ] Refactor and clean up Vue code (help wanted!)
- [ ] Allow custom styles (for now you can use XStyle and DarkReader, for example)
- [ ] Better support for mobile screens (help wanted!)

## Usage

### Dependencies

This project utilises some Python 3.10 features, such as the `match` syntax, and a minimal set of dependencies:
```
flask
flask-cors
waitress
```

### Local Deployment

The simplest method to use this app is to run it locally. I would recommend running the custom HTTP server in the `http_server` sub-directory, which forwards requests under `/api` to the backend, and serves static files in `.dist/`.

```bash
cd client
yarn build
mv dist ../http_server/
```
And then:
```bash
python3.10 http_server/http_server.py
python3.10 server/server.py
```

Then access it at [localhost:8081](http://localhost:8081). Please note that the favicon may be missing.

Alternatively, you could use dedicated HTTP servers such as nginx to serve the static files and proxy API requests. Check out the sample [config](/nginx.conf) for more information.


### Server Deployment

I recommend nginx if you plan to deploy SilverDict to a server. Before building the static files, be sure to modify `SERVER_URL` in `App.vue`, and then place them into whatever directory where nginx looks for static files. Remember to reverse-proxy all API requests and permit methods other than `GET` and `POST`.

Assuming your distribution uses `systemd`, you can refer to the provided sample `systemd` [config](/silverdict.service) and run the script as a service.

NB: currently the API server is memory-inefficient due to the way `MDictReader` is designed. Running the server with eight mid- to large-sized dictionaries consumes ~250 MB of memory.
